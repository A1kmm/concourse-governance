  Shipping the Concourse product and maintaining a high standard for quality,
  stability, and security.

# TODO: due to boring legal/compliance reasons this team is currently limited
# to VMware employees.
#
# Concourse is shipped directly to VMware customers, so we'll need to introduce
# infrastructure to ensure everything we ship has been vetted by VMware. for
# example, an internal mirror with only vetted changes manually synced, and an
# internal pipeline that builds from that mirror.
